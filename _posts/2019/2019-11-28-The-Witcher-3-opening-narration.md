I see you gather before me... hungry... terrified... Clutching your babes to your breast.

各位聚集在我面前……饥肠辘辘又恐慌不安……

胸前还紧抱着孩子。

Emperor Emhyr has marched his legions into our lands... Laid siege to every fortress from here to the Blue Mountains.. Rabid and ravenous, he bites and bites away.

恩希尔大帝的军团已经攻入了我们的土地……朝这儿到蓝山的所有堡垒发动攻势……它的攻击猛烈又贪婪，我们的土地一点一滴沦陷。

Men of the north, you stand at the precipice! Your kings have failed you, so now you turn to the gods! And yet you do not plead? You do not kneel to dust your heads with ash? Instead you wail, "Why have the gods forsaken us?"

北方的人民啊，你们现在深处绝境！国王辜负了你们，于是你们现在转向天神求助。

但是你们并没有恳求？也没有跪下来虔诚祷告？

你们反而哭喊【为什么天神抛弃了我们？】

We must look into the trials we failed long ago!

这全是我们许久以前磨练失败的结果！

In a time past, our world intertwined with another through an upheaval scholars call the Conjunction of the Spheres...

很久很久以前，我们的世界与另一个世界交会产生巨变，学者称此为天球交会……

The gods allowed unholy forces to slip into our domains. The offspring of that cataclysm was the nefarious force called magic...

天神让不洁的势力进入了我们的领域。

那场剧烈变动留下了许多邪恶的遗毒，像是魔法……

Yet we did not banish it, instead studying the vile arcane for our own power and wealth! And the monsters at our door... the unholy relics of this Conjunction?

但我们没有禁止魔法，反而靠着研读这种邪恶古代力量增进威力和财富！

还有来到我们家门口的怪物……天球交会的余孽？

...the trolls... the corpse eaters... the werewolves? Did we raise our swords against them? Or have we laid this burden on others?

……巨魔……

……食尸生物……

狼人？我们拿剑驱逐他们了吗？还是把责任推给别人？

On so-called Witchers... Stray children taught the ways of foul sorcery, their bodies mutated through blasphemous ritual. Sent to fight monsters they could not distinguish good from evil. The flicker of humanity long extinguished within them.

我们全交给了狩魔猎人……这些误入歧途的孩子学习了肮脏的巫术，还经过了亵渎的仪式使身体突变。

连善恶都无法分辨，就被送去跟怪物作战。他们最后一丝的人性早已湮灭。

Yes, their numbers have dwindled throughout the years. But still few roam our lands, offering their bloody work for coin. To this day they shame us with their very existence!

是的，他们的数量近年来越来越少。但依然有几个狩魔猎人四处游荡，以肮脏的工作换取金钱。他们的存在就是我们的耻辱！

The north bleeds, flogged by war! The battles are the gods' whip, chastisement for our sins!

战胜时北方满目疮痍。这些都是天神的鞭挞，要惩戒我们的罪恶！

And let us not forget the terrors, the scourges from beyond our world! The Wild Hunt rules the skies with every full moon! The dark raiders abduct our children into lands unknown! Some say they herald a second Conjunction!

别忘了还有另一个世界来的恐惧与灾祸！每次满月时狂猎都会在天边出现！

这些黑暗骑士把我们的孩子绑架到未知的世界！甚至有人说他们的出现时第二次天球交会的预兆！

Can we chart a course back into the light? Will we find the strength to banish the mages from our kingdoms? Unite around the warmth of the Eternal Fire?

我们能否重返光明？能否鼓起勇气把法师赶出我们的王国？在永恒之火的温暖光辉之下同心协力？

Nigh is the Time of the Sword and Axe! None will fight this war in our stead! Nigh is the Time of Madness and Disdain!

剑与斧的年代将临！

没有人会代替我们打这场战争！

疯狂与堕落的年代将临！
